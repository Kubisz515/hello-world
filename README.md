# Pace On Purdue

“Pace is live in Purdue. 200 smart bikes, all for you”

## **How to Use Pace**

**In the App**

The Pace app is available on Apple’s App Store and Google Play. When you open the Pace app after downloading, the app will then prompt you to put your first and last name, email, and number. Your number is needed in order to verify your account, and a code will be sent to your phone with a four digit pin to enter in the app. 

Afterwards, the app will ask you your preferred method to pay. However, this step can be skipped for later. Next, you will see three steps to help you use pace:
1. Find a Bike – The map will show bikes at Pace stations.
1. Choose Your Bike – Each bike has a number by the handlebars, match the number in the app.
1 .Unlock & Ride – Select the bike you want to ride, the lock will open automatically and you remove the cable.

**While Using the Pace Bike**
1. Make Quick Stops – If needed, you can make a quick stop by putting your Pace bike on a pace or public rack (Pace rack =blue pin, public rack = white pin).
1. End Your Ride – In order to end your ride, find a Pace or public rack, tap ‘end rental’ in the app, and slide down the orange tab. Secure the bike to the pace or public rack with the cable. 


## **Going the Distances**

**LeaperX**

From 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., riders can travel from "one of approximately 50 central, on-campus locations to a selection of perimeter destinations and back again." This will include the following:

1. Purdue University Airport
1. Purdue Technology Center Aerospace
1. Zucrow Laboratories
1. Parking and Transportation Services
1. Surplus Store
1. East Airport Parking Lot

Leaper X will replace both the CityBus Black Loop and the Av Tech stop on the Gold Loop for the remainder of Fall 2019 semester in the coming weeks. Students that rely on the Gold Loop and the Black Loop for their transportation instead of Pace, or just in general, might need to download the new app and use the Leaper X service instead.

**Purdue University Airport**

This specific location is far away from most of the buildings the majority of students have classes in, which makes transportation from here especially difficult for students that need a reliable ride. If students at the Purdue University Airport do not have their own car, bike, skateboard/longboard, Pace does have one station located there.

**Other Bus Routes**

If students do not have the money to pay for the Pace service, then the “Gold Loop” CityBus reaches all the way to the Purdue University Airport. The CityBus is free to any Purdue student with a Purdue I.D. The CityBus also has several routes in this area; Gold Loop, Silver Loop, Black Loop, Tower Acres, Ross Ade, and Outer Loop.

## **Pace and the Weather**

Pace does not offer help when weather can be an issue. According to BestPlaces.com, “West Lafayette, Indiana gets 38 inches of rain, on average, per year,” and  “averages 19 inches of snow per year.” The rain statistic is the nation’s average, and the snow statistic is nine inches below the average. 

**Pace and the Rain**

Pace is not meant to be the answer to rain or snow, however can still be an option to choose when deciding how fast you need to get to another location. The roads, sidewalks and bike paths can all become slippery and rubber tires on bicycles, even with good treads, is subject to slipping on these surfaces. When a student is considering what to choose, it may be safer for them to use the CityBus, or just walk with an umbrella/rain jacket. 

**Pace and the Snow**

Pace cannot combat the cold weather and snow any better than a regular bicycle would. Ice, black ice, lightly packed snow, sleet, or any other form of snow can still cause accidents if a student is not careful while riding over it. The cold is now also part of the problem. In which case, the CityBus is a great way for students to travel across campus if they want to escape the cold, stay warm, and do not mind to wait for it.
